## About
OMD is a large collection of melodic presets for [Divisimate v1.4+](https://www.divisimate.com) organized by range, section and blends commonly found across orchestral repertoire.



## Setup
1. In Github, click on each .dpfe file and download the raw file.
2. In Divisimate, click the Perform view and select Manage Performances. Import both .dpfe files. Then add them to Quickload Menu Slots from All Saved Performances.
3. Back in the Perform view, select a performance and explore its presets.


The name prefix describes a preset's range. (LH) is Low to High, (LM) is Low to Medium, etc. Between instrument names, a + means in unison and - means in octaves. For example, _(LM) V1 + V2 - Vla + Vcl - DB_ means Violins 1 and 2 in unison, with Violas and Celli in unison an octave below and Double Bass an octave below that.



## Known Issues
OMD is not endorsed by Paul Humphreys or Andy McCluskey. They're swell chaps nonetheless.
