## Orchestral Melodies 1 & 2
A collection of presets organized by range, section and blends commonly found across orchestral repertoire.  
The name prefix describes a preset's range. (LH) is Low to High, (LM) is Low to Medium, etc. Between instrument names, a + means in unison and - means in octaves. For example, _V1 + V2 - Vla + Vcl - DB_ means Violins 1 and 2 in unison, with Violas and Celli in unison an octave below and Double Bass an octave below that.

## Prison Breakout
_Steffen Brinkman was wrongly accused of murder. After months of incarceration, it's time to escape!_  
This performance contains 9 presets (intros, mains and climaxes) and a multipad. Demo video below.
